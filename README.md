# Flutter Cyber Blocks

This minimal Flutter project demonstrates a special visual effect that appears
when the player clears exactly four lines at once (a **Tetris**). When this
occurs, a glowing explosion overlays the board for 300ms.

Run the app and tap on the board to simulate clearing four lines and trigger the
effect. The game logic is simplified for demonstration purposes.
